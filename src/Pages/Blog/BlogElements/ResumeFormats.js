              The phrase “resume format” is often a confusing one, since
              different sources use this term to refer to different/multiple
              things. <br />
              In the most basic sense, a resume format is the type of structure
              your resume has depending on the order in which resume sections
              are presented, how the employment history section is written and
              which sections are given the most emphasis.

              Luckily when it comes to choosing a resume format, your choices
              are already narrowed down to three main types:
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>1. Reverse chronological </b>
              <br />
              <b>2. Functional</b> <br />
              <b> 3. Combination</b> <br /> In the most basic sense, a resume
              format is the type of structure your resume has depending on the
              order in which resume sections are presented, how the employment
              history section is written and which sections are given the most
              emphasis.
              <br />
              Each one offers unique advantages and there are no best resume
              templates. You may even want to create a version of your resume in
              each format depending on the job title, the company or even the
              country in which you are applying. An online resume builder can
              make it much easier to quickly switch around sections and go from
              one format to another without much fuss.
